* What is the project idea /What the Big Data application does?
             
     **Problem Statement:** 


> A senior climate scientist in the Arctic is worried about the extinction of polar bears in the region. He has placed hundreds of motion-activated cameras at marked location throughout the region. He now wants to devise an automated system that can process data from these cameras in real time and can display some sort of notification when a bear is clicked. He would also need a very fast ‘over-the-cloud’ service to recognize bears in these photographs so that he and his team can take appropriate actions. <br />
                              The project idea deals with building a big-data application using Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Cognitive Services. Data in the form of photos will be streamed and processed real-time and will be analyzed via an image recognition service. The results will done by presented in a customized dashboard using data from a fully deployed database. Therefore, the application follows the entire flow of collecting, classifying and visualizing big data in the real world. 
                            

* What are the technologies used? <br />
1. Microsoft Azure IoT Hub 
2. Microsoft Azure Storage
3. Microsoft Azure Stream Analytics
4. Microsoft Azure Functions
5. Microsoft Custom Vision Service
6. Microsoft Power BI
7. Microsoft Azure SQL Database 

* Solution for each requirement present in the problem statement? <br />

1. Microsoft Azure IoT Hub: This can be used to ingest any kind of streaming data via a simulated recording media for example - cameras. 
2. Microsoft Azure Storage: Any kind of streaming data can be stored here. 
3. Microsoft Azure Stream Analytics: This service can be used to process real-time data streams. 
4. Microsoft Azure Function: This service can be used to process outputs from the Stream Analytics service. 
5. Microsoft Custom Vision Service: This service can be used to analyze/recognize images. 
6. Microsoft Power BI: This service can be used to create customized dashboards for data visualization. 
7. Microsoft Azure SQL Database: This service can be used to store relational data.
